        <p>I love drawing because it gave me respect. It made me popular among my friends. One of the major reasons why I love drawing because it gives me wings to fly. I can draw anything which is in my mind. I can express my thoughts through drawing. I draw various things. I draw for a social cause. I draw about the current situation. I love drawing because I can speak through my drawing and painting without uttering a word. I love drawing because this hobby is my favorite timepass. I draw in every mood. It helps me put my emotions on the canvas. Whenever I feel low or sad, I just put my sketchbook out from the cupboard and start drawing anything, whatever in my mind. People call it freestyle painting, it means without any purpose. After that, I feel very satisfied.</p>

        <h2> my teacher </h2>
        
        A good teacher is one that motivates the students to always keep trying and do their best. However, an ethical and virtuous teacher is one who changes a studentâ€™s life forever and shapes their character into becoming a successful and respectful human being. Teachers have an important part in our lives and they impact us every day. Not only do they teach us something new each passing day, they also give us lessons that we will use in every decision we make in our lives.  Luckily, I was able to have a teacher who pushed me beyond all my limits and always believed in me. That marvelous teacher was my fourth-grade teacher, Miss. prachi.
